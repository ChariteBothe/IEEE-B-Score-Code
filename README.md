# IEEE-B-Score-Code

This is the complementary code scripz section for the B-Score Paper published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. It is an Open Source script available under the GNU General Public License.
This script allows you to analyse your BP estimation dataset and calculate the base performances needed for B-Score calculation. If you choose to provide your T-RMSE value, this script will directly allow you to calculate your model's B-Score.

How to use:
It is highly recommended to run the script in the Google Colaboratory environment to ensure ideal functionality. If you choose to run the script in another environment, please make sure all required libraries are installed on your machine.

To make sure you have all required libraries installed with the correct versions, please check the publication and the code-cell below for detailed information.

Cells containing necessary imports or utility functions are collapsed in the "User Version" of the script. Please run them by pressing Shift + ENTER. You can access the underlying code directly by opening the "Open Code" version.

Cells containing optional functionality will be highlighted by explanatory texts beforehand. If you wish to inspect the code double click on collapsed cells to expand them.


Thank you for using the complementary B-Score calculation script. We are looking forward to see your publication and your B-Score results.
